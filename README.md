# story_plots_challenge

Welcome to the "Story plots" challenge!

Here's a list of 112,937 plots extracted from wikipedia: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1JsORDo4i58m7z6uCpINtiixWmQWC2R-8

Your challenge is to programmatically label as many as you can as having a female protagonist. The titles of the plots are included as well.

There is no upper or lower absolute number or % of plots that you identify, what we are interested in is the creative approach to a simple yet complex natural language processing task.

Fork this repository privately and push the solution to your repo.

We look forward to be inspired by your solutions.
